# Prune superseded sandbox images — both prebuilt sets and local builds.
#
# Two independent sources of dead image data pile up on a host:
#
#   Prebuilt sets: every release/commit whose prebuilt set is pulled lands a
#   multi-GB ghcr.io/<owner>/secure-claude-{sandbox,monitor,ccr}:git-<sha> trio on
#   disk, and nothing reclaims the previous set on `brew upgrade`, `brew uninstall`,
#   or a new commit — so they accumulate forever (each pinned release retains its
#   own set).
#
#   Local builds: `docker compose build` re-tags secure-claude-sandbox:local onto
#   the freshly built image, orphaning the image the tag used to point at into a
#   dangling <none> entry. Those superseded builds are pure waste — the build CACHE
#   (a separate store, see gc-build-cache.bash) is what makes the next rebuild fast,
#   not the stale image layers — so we reclaim them even on a dev host that builds
#   locally and even when this launch isn't a prebuilt "candidate".
#
# The wrapper runs this on every sandboxed launch; opt out with CLAUDE_NO_IMAGE_GC=1.
# Mirrors bin/lib/gc-volumes.bash.
#
# Safety:
#   Prebuilt — remove a secure-claude-* image tagged git-<sha> only when <sha> is
#   NOT this launch's active sha AND no container is built on it. The active sha
#   comes from resolve-image.bash's own ref derivation (HEAD in a checkout, the
#   formula's baked release ref in a Homebrew install), so it can never disagree
#   with what a launch resolves. We prune only when that positively identifies a
#   prebuilt set ("candidate"): any other state (dirty, prebuilt disabled, no git
#   remote) builds locally and pins no git-<sha> image, so we skip that pass rather
#   than guess and risk deleting a set a later flag-flip would want back. Locally
#   built :local images carry no git-<sha> tag and are never matched there.
#   Local — a dangling image is reaped only when it carries our build LABEL
#   (claude-guard.git-commit, stamped by .devcontainer/Dockerfile), so an unrelated
#   project's dangling images are never touched. The live :local image keeps its tag
#   (so it is not dangling) and is never matched; nor is the active prebuilt set
#   (tagged). Only the sandbox image carries the label, so monitor/ccr local orphans
#   aren't reaped here — they're small, and labeling them would change image-build
#   inputs (forcing a supply-chain republish) for little gain.
