  # The host wrapper is bash with associative arrays and ${var,,}; macOS ships
  # bash 3.2, so a modern bash must win on PATH. jq parses the firewall
  # allowlist; git drives the worktree/snapshot features; node/npm back pnpm and
  # the in-image install. `devcontainer` is homebrew-core's @devcontainers/cli,
  # the one host CLI the launcher shells out to — so depend on it directly.
  #
  # The container daemon (Docker engine / Colima / OrbStack / Docker Desktop)
  # and the host Claude Code CLI are NOT depends_on: OrbStack, Docker Desktop,
  # and the `claude-code` CLI are casks (a formula cannot depend on a cask, and
  # casks are macOS-only), brew deps are unconditional (no "install only if a
  # runtime is missing"), and a brew `docker` would collide with the apt engine
  # on Linux. The bundled setup.bash detects an existing runtime and provisions
  # the rest platform-correctly, only when absent — see caveats.

  def install
    # The launcher builds the sandbox image locally (a Homebrew install is not a
    # git checkout, so the signed-prebuilt fast path can't match a git-<sha>
    # tag) and resolves its .devcontainer stack relative to bin/, so the whole
    # tree must ship together. Drop only dev/CI artifacts the runtime never
    # reads.

    <<~EOS
      claude-guard and the devcontainer CLI are installed. The container runtime
      is not a brew dependency (OrbStack/Docker Desktop are casks; brew deps are
      unconditional), so run the bundled provisioner once — it detects an
      existing Docker Desktop / OrbStack / Colima and only installs a runtime
      when none is found (idempotent; prompts per install, or SCCD_ASSUME_YES=1):

        #{opt_libexec}/setup.bash

      The pinned `claude` that runs your session lives in the sandbox image. For
      a host `claude` (for `claude setup-token` and --dangerously-skip-container)
      on macOS:  brew install --cask claude-code

      Then capture an auth token and verify protection:

        claude setup-token
        claude-guard doctor

      To route the bare `claude` command through the sandbox, add to your shell
      rc file:
        alias claude=claude-guard
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "claude-guard", shell_output("#{bin}/claude-guard --help")
  end
end
