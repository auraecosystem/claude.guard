"""Drift guard for the EGRESS_QUOTA_MB end-to-end probe.

The actual byte-cap enforcement is proven by the privileged-docker e2e
(bin/check-egress-quota.bash -> tests/smoke/egress-quota-probe.sh), which needs
NET_ADMIN and a real kernel `-m quota` match and so runs only in CI
(egress-quota-smoke.yaml), never under pytest here. What pytest CAN guard,
deterministically and with no container, is that the probe's REPLAYED quota-rule
sequence has not drifted from the canonical block in init-firewall.bash — so a
wiring change to the real ordering still fails a check, even though the probe
doesn't run the full init script.

These are string/structure assertions on the two source files; they import no
container and assert the exact rule text, not a paraphrase.
