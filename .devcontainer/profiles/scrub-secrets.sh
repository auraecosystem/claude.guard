# Strip secret-bearing environment variables from shells so a compromised
# or prompt-injected agent can't read credentials out of the environment.
#
# Wired in two ways by the Dockerfile:
#   1. /etc/profile.d/scrub-secrets.sh  — sourced by interactive/login bash.
#   2. BASH_ENV=/etc/scrub-secrets.sh   — sourced by EVERY non-interactive
#      `bash -c "..."`, which is how Claude Code's Bash tool runs commands.
#      Without (2) the scrub would only protect a human at a terminal and be
#      blind to the agent's actual tool calls — the very actor it constrains.
#
# Because BASH_ENV makes this run on every non-interactive bash invocation
# (including nested subshells), it must be cheap and side-effect-safe:
#   * Iterate the shell's own variable names via `compgen -v` (a builtin) —
#     no `env` subprocess, no pipe, no per-invocation fork. This is what lets
#     it sit on BASH_ENV without a fork storm.
#   * It only `unset`s variables; running it twice is a no-op (idempotent),
#     so re-sourcing in nested shells is harmless.
#
# Note on the agent's own process: this only scrubs *shells*. The `claude`
# process inherits its env at exec time (before any shell runs), so any var it
# legitimately needs (e.g. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, were it set) stays available to
# claude itself — while a child `bash -c` spawned by the Bash tool gets a
# scrubbed view. That asymmetry is the point: the model's shell can't read the
# key even though claude can use it.

# Built-in must-keeps. These either match a secret glob but are not secrets,
# or are required for the container/runtime to function:
#   NODE_OPTIONS, NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION
#     — runtime config (original allowlist).
#   NPM_CONFIG_IGNORE_SCRIPTS — set in the image; not a secret.
# Proxy vars (http_proxy/https_proxy/NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS/no_proxy) and
# MONITOR_PORT do NOT match any secret glob, so they need no exception.
