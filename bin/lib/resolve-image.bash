# Strategy (see README "Prebuilt sandbox image"): CI publishes the three
# compose images to GHCR tagged `git-<full-sha>`. A checkout already knows its
# own commit SHA, so we derive the exact tag with no lockfile or writeback. If
# every image for this commit is present in the registry we pull them and pin
# compose to them (SCCD_PULL_POLICY=never); otherwise we leave the compose
# defaults untouched and the image builds locally (the safe fallback).
#
# Opt out with SCCD_NO_PREBUILT=1 (always build locally).

# Parse the GitHub owner from the repo's origin remote, lowercased (GHCR
# image paths must be lowercase). Returns non-zero if it isn't a github.com
# remote.
