# Runs INSIDE the secure-claude-sandbox image, as root, in a PRIVILEGED netns
# (--cap-add NET_ADMIN). Proves that EGRESS_QUOTA_MB is a real, byte-exact hard
# cap on outbound traffic to allowed domains: traffic flows until ~1 MB has
# crossed the quota rule, after which ALL further allowed-domain egress is
# REJECTed for the rest of the session.
#
# Why a dummy interface and not loopback: init-firewall.bash ACCEPTs OUTPUT to
# 127.0.0.0/8 and the sandbox subnet BEFORE the quota rule, so loopback traffic
# never reaches `-m quota` (it short-circuits the budget). We instead stand up a
# dummy interface bearing a genuinely PUBLIC ip (93.184.216.34 — outside every
# BOGON_CIDRS range), add that ip to the `allowed-domains` ipset, and serve a
# large body from an origin bound to it. Traffic to it is local (no external
# network) yet still traverses the OUTPUT chain and the quota rule, exactly as
# real allowed-domain egress would.
#
# Determinism: we instrument the kernel's `-m quota` byte counter, never timing.
# `iptables -Z OUTPUT` zeroes the rule counters; we then drive a deterministic
# byte volume and ASSERT, via `iptables -L OUTPUT -v -n -x`, that the over-quota
# REJECT rule's packet counter went 0 -> >0 (the budget was exhausted). The flip
# is the teeth: the SAME endpoint is reachable before the cap and REJECTed after;
# the only thing that changed is the byte budget. REJECT (icmp-admin-prohibited)
# fails the client instantly, so the post-quota outcome needs no polling.
#
# We REPLAY the exact quota-rule sequence from init-firewall.bash (the IP firewall
# block through the over-quota REJECT) rather than running the full script: a
# cold-boot init resolves ~150 live domains and fails closed on zero essentials,
# which is impossible with no external network. The replayed block is copied
# verbatim from the source and is asserted to MATCH it by
# tests/test_egress_quota_e2e.py (a drift guard), so a wiring change to the real
# ordering is still caught.
#
# Prints PASS:/FAIL: lines; exits non-zero if any assertion failed.

# and pinned against the source by tests/test_egress_quota_e2e.py. We DELIBERATELY
# omit the source's leading `iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT`: our origin binds a
# local /32, and the kernel routes any locally-assigned address out the LOOPBACK
# device (`ip route get <local-ip>` => `dev lo`), so an `-o lo` accept would
# short-circuit the very PUBLIC_IP packets before they reach the quota rule and the
# budget would never decrement (the test would pass vacuously). With it omitted,
# PUBLIC_IP traffic hits the ipset quota/REJECT rules by destination regardless of
# the carrier device, exactly as real allowed-domain egress would.
#
# We do NOT set the OUTPUT policy to DROP: the assertion is purely the quota/REJECT
# counters on the allowed-domains ipset traffic, and leaving the policy at ACCEPT
# keeps unrelated host traffic from interfering — only packets to PUBLIC_IP hit the
# ipset rules, and PUBLIC_IP is the only member of the set.
