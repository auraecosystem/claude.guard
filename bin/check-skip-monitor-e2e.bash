# End-to-end proof that --dangerously-skip-monitor DISENGAGES the monitor at
# runtime — and that a normal launch ENGAGES it — by exercising the REAL
# .claude/hooks/monitor-dispatch.bash through its real host-mode opt-out branch.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: skip-monitor's only prior coverage (tests/test_ephemeral.py)
# asserts the PERMISSION-MODE flag the launcher passes to claude; it never proves
# the monitor actually stops evaluating tool calls. That is a vacuous green: the
# disengagement itself — monitor-dispatch.bash:305, `DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_MONITOR=1
# => exit 0 before any monitor call` — is untested, so a regression that left the
# monitor engaged (or one that silently disengaged it on a normal launch) would
# ship green. This check pins the boundary the flag is FOR.
#
# THE ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL we observe is the monitor's own `monitor_decided` trace
# event (config/trace-events.json; emitted by monitorlib/audit.py:log_decision via
# the opt-in CLAUDE_GUARD_TRACE channel). It is the single runtime witness that the
# Python monitor evaluated a call. Present == engaged; absent == disengaged. To make
# it deterministic and OFFLINE (no API key, no network, no flake) we drive a
# PermissionDenied call under a tripped spend cap: handle_permission_denied's
# cost-capped branch (monitorlib/core.py) logs a decision — emitting monitor_decided
# — WITHOUT calling the API. The skip path never reaches that code at all.
#
# THE BOUNDARY ASSERTED, both directions:
#   * monitor ENGAGED (no DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_MONITOR): the dispatcher runs monitor.py,
#     which emits exactly one `monitor_decided` trace line AND writes one audit
#     record. Two independent witnesses, so "present" can't be a probe artifact.
#   * monitor SKIPPED (DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_MONITOR=1): the dispatcher exits 0 at the
#     opt-out branch BEFORE invoking monitor.py — NO monitor_decided line, NO audit
#     record — yet still exits 0 (the launch keeps working, the call isn't blocked).
# A negative ("absent") is only trustworthy once the positive proved the lever fires,
# so the skip checks are --needs-gated on the engaged check passing first.
#
# SCOPE — host-mode boundary, by design. monitor-dispatch.bash checks
# DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_MONITOR only in its HOST branch (priority 3); in a real
# devcontainer the dispatcher takes the sidecar-POST branch (priority 2) and the
# flag is not wired into the container at all (it is absent from the app service's
# environment in .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml and from the handover `docker exec`
# in bin/lib/launch.bash). So --dangerously-skip-monitor genuinely disengages the
# monitor only in host mode (--dangerously-skip-sandbox); inside the sandbox it is a
# documented no-op. This check therefore exercises the dispatcher in host mode
# (CLAUDE_ENV=host: no IS_SANDBOX, no /run/hardening/complete, no DEVCONTAINER) —
# which is exactly where the disengagement lives — inside the real app image (real
# bash + jq + python3 + the baked monitorlib), without booting the full stack.
#
# Docker is unavailable in the dev sandbox, so this runs in CI
# (.github/workflows/skip-monitor-e2e.yaml). Runnable locally with Docker.
#
# COLLECT-ALL: checks run through bin/lib/check-harness.bash so one container
# bring-up harvests every broken invariant, not just the first.
